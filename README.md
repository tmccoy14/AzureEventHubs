# Azure Event Hubs

### This repository contains an application that sends events to and receive events from an Azure Event Hub.

### I followed [Send events to or receive events from event hubs by using Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-python-get-started-send) which was really easy to follow and set up.

### I created the necessary resources with Terraform which I have included in the `terraform` directory.
